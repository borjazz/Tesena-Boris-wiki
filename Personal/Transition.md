## Old Wise Men Group: Summer After Party 

-   Retaining: Relationship (personal relationship with others in Tesena) 
    
-   Fluctuate: Specific/exceptional opportunity for growth that Tesena cannot provide 
    
    -   However, in some cases we could have if we had known this was a desire 
        
-   Fluctuate: Cannot create or own something, our work is transitory, we are not there until the end 
    
-   Fluctuate: We are externals, we are not in the "core team" at the clients, we do not "belong" 
    
-   Retaining/Fluctuates: Connection: Common theme 
    
-   Fluctuates: First Work Experience 
    
    -   Tesena is only a good first step: Bridge to a proper job 
        
    -   Not able to evaluate Tesena advantages properly 
        
    -   Short term focus on basic needs - money 
        
    -   Should we work with expectation of high fluctuation? Should we build it into our financial model, do we calculate the break even point? 
        
-   Retaining: Career path / more possibilities 
    
    -   Different clients/projects 
        
    -   Different project roles: now wider with BA and SM 
        
    -   Possibility for internal roles (e.g. mentor) 
        
-   What do Teseners want, why are they here? 
    
-   Protect the core
